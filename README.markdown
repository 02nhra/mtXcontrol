# mtXcontrol - a Rainbowduino Editor -

mtXcontrol is an editor written in Processing to easily create image sequences for the [Rainbowduino controller](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/rainbowduino-led-driver-platform-plug-and-shine-p-371.html). The Rainbowduino is a 8x8 RGB LED driver  controler created by seeedstudio, based on the Arduino Project.

With *mtXcontrol* Editor you can draw points, lines &amp; rows in different colors, create multiple frames and manipulate them. Add, delete, move, fill, copy &amp; paste of frames is supported. Play all frames by different speed, liveupdate the controller and save your work to file or upload it to Rainbowduino to make it standalone (mind: due to 256kb memory only up to 10 frames can be stored by now). A special feature is typing letters and numbers. Future versions aim to support multiple controllers and

## Mini HowTo:
mtXcontrol consits of two parts:  One is the Editor program which you run on your computer, the other is the firmware you have to upload to your rainbowduino. [See instruction here](http://www.rngtng.com/2009/06/25/rainbowduino-here-it-is-and-how-to-program-it).  The firmware make use of the Rainbowduino.h Library to manioulate the Matrix easily. Connect your Rainbowduino via USB to your computer and you are ready to go - happy mtXcontrol drawing!

## Full list of Features:
* Draw multicolor points, line and rows  (8bit color support)
* Add, delete, clear, fill, *copy &amp; paste*, move frames
* *Draw letters and numbers*, Font configureable
* Save &amp; Load to File
* Upload and Download to Matrix *EEPROM* (mind: due to 256kb memory only up to 10 frames). 
* Frame preview, easily navigate through
* Standalone Mode or realtime Rainbowudino Update
* Keyboard shortcut for each function

## Future ideas:
* Use compression to save more frames to EEPROM (e.g. Huffman?)
* Font configuration
* Support for multiple Rainbowduinos
* Standart import/export file format
* Support other devices
* More colors 

## Keyboard shortcuts:
* ENTER - switch between record /place Mode
* <left/right ARROW> - Frame forward/backward (Record Mode) or Speed in Place Mode
* SPACE - Insert Frame after current Frame
* S - Save to File
* L - Load File
* D - Delete Frame
* C - Clear frame
* F - fill frame

* command+C - Copy Frame
* command+V - Paste Frame

* ctrl+<LETTER> - Insert this Letter/Number
* crtl+<left/right ARROW> - Move Frame in direction

* alt+ENTER - connect/disconnect to Rainbowduino
* alt+<left/right ARROW> - Adjust speed on Rainbowduino
* alt+L - download from Rainbowduino
* alt+S - upload from Rainbowduino
